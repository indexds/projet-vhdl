LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell button_right_was_pressed_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) minutes_counter_reg[0]/CLR, minutes_counter_reg[1]/CLR, minutes_counter_reg[2]/CLR, minutes_counter_reg[3]/CLR, seconds_counter_reg[0]/CLR, seconds_counter_reg[1]/CLR, seconds_counter_reg[2]/CLR, seconds_counter_reg[3]/CLR, tens_minutes_counter_reg[0]/CLR, tens_minutes_counter_reg[1]/CLR, tens_minutes_counter_reg[2]/CLR, tens_seconds_counter_reg[0]/CLR, tens_seconds_counter_reg[1]/CLR, tens_seconds_counter_reg[2]/CLR.
